## Microplastics Exposure

### Plastic Bottles
**Threshold:** >0.5/day moderate concern, >1/day elevated concern

**Research Findings:**
- Consuming tap water leads to ~4,000 microplastics (MPs) annually
- Bottled water consumption adds ~90,000 additional MPs per year
- No official Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) exists for microplastics

**Health Concerns:**
- Microplastics can act as vectors for chemical additives (phthalates, bisphenols)
- Associated with oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and immune dysregulation
- Smallest particles (<1 µm) can penetrate deep into lungs and potentially enter bloodstream
