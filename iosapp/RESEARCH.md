This document outlines the scientific research and health guidelines that inform DataDiet's tracking thresholds and recommendations.

## Microplastics Exposure

### Plastic Bottles
**Threshold:** >0.5/day moderate concern, >1/day elevated concern

**Research Findings:**
- Consuming tap water leads to ~4,000 microplastics (MPs) annually
- Bottled water consumption adds ~90,000 additional MPs per year
- No official Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) exists for microplastics

**Health Concerns:**
- Microplastics can act as vectors for chemical additives (phthalates, bisphenols)
- Associated with oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and immune dysregulation
- Smallest particles (<1 µm) can penetrate deep into lungs and potentially enter bloodstream

### Hot Food in Plastic
**Threshold:** Any regular exposure is concerning

**Research Findings:**
- Heat significantly increases plastic leaching
- Microplastic release accelerates with temperature
- Avoid microwaving food in plastic containers

**Research Findings:**
- FDA maximum: **400mg/day** (~4 cups of coffee)
- Toxic effects (seizures) at ~1,200mg rapid consumption
- Caffeine after 2pm significantly impacts sleep quality
- Pregnant women: limit to 200mg/day

**Standard Caffeine Content:**
- 8 oz brewed coffee: ~95mg
- 8 oz black tea: ~47mg
- 12 oz cola: ~34mg

## Alcohol

**Threshold:** >7 drinks/week moderate, >14 drinks/week elevated

**Research Findings:**
- CDC moderate drinking guidelines:
  - Women: 1 drink or less per day
  - Men: 2 drinks or less per day
- Heavy drinking defined as:
  - Women: 8+ drinks/week
  - Men: 15+ drinks/week
- Alcohol accounts for **6% of all US cancers** and 4% of cancer deaths
- Even moderate drinking increases mortality risk vs. not drinking
